# Hi there 👋
高三牲，时不时写一些有趣的项目，致力于用代码解决实际问题，平时学业繁忙，发现BUG或者对我的项目有建议欢迎在issue中反馈，我会在周六周日作出回应与更改。

I am a senior high school student in China, occasionally working on interesting projects. I am dedicated to solving real-world problems through code. Though my academic schedule is quite hectic, if you discover any bugs or have suggestions for my projects, feel free to provide feedback in the issue section. I will review and make updates during weekends.
